I am a physicist with a strong interest in applied sciences. My research deals with Complex Networks, Data Science and their application to social systems in general.

I am currently a PhD Student at Queen Mary University of London in the [Complex Systems and Networks group](http://www.maths.qmul.ac.uk/complex-systems-and-networks/complex-systems-and-networks-group) under the supervision of [Vito Latora](http://www.maths.qmul.ac.uk/~latora/). 

Previously, I worked at the [Institute for Scientific Interchange (ISI) Foundation](http://www.isi.it/en/home) in Turin, within the [Data Science](http://www.isi.it/en/research/data-science) and [Mathematics & Foundation of Complex Systems](http://www.isi.it/en/research/mathematics-foundation-of-complex-systems) groups, under the supervision of [Laetitia Gauvin](https://laetitiagauvin.github.io/) and [Giovanni Petri](https://lordgrilo.github.io/).

I received my Master's degree in **Physics of Complex Systems** from the University of Torino in October 2015.
